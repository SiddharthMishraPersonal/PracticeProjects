2006-05-25 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Implemented AsyncWrapper for .NET CF using the Timer class
	* Refactored file watching - should speed up non-logging by 100%

2006-05-20 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

2006-04-18 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added LayoutRenderer.IsAppDomainFixed() and an optimization to turn
	such things into literals.
	* Added LoggingConfiguration.GetConfiguredNamedTargets() API
	* BREAKING CHANGE - Completely restructured the way File target works.
	The new structure is based on Streams instead of StreamWriters and
	enables archiving (kind of similar to "rolling file appender" from log4net
	world, but supporting multiple files at a time)
	* BREAKING CHANGE - removed some properties which accepted strings. Now
	replaced with enums.
	* Added caching to File target to optimize the number file open/close
	operations
	* Added an option for multiple processes to append to the same OPEN file
	in a synchronized manner. Unixes get this   for free, but Win32 requires
	you to use mutexes to synchronize file access.
	* Enabled the use of enumerations as parameteters (including docgen)
	* Added InternalLogger.LogToConsoleError and their config file and
	environment variable counterparts
	* Refactored website generation

	* Added ${aspnet-sessionid} to access (guess!) ASP.NET session ID

2005-10-25 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added ASPNetBufferingWrapper target which buffers and post-processes
	the entire ASP.NET request (requires you to use the NLogHttpModule)
	* Added PostFilteringWrapper target which is able to filter log events
	based on a buffer as a whole. It is possible for example to dump the
	detailed ( >= Trace level) trace of a request if there was at least 
	one >= Warn event in the buffer, but under normal conditions only output
	the >= Info levels.
	* Reworked the way the documentation is generated (we no longer use
	ugly IFRAMEs and the same method is used to generate the website and
	the docs)
	* Added a new conditions language (see conditions.html for more
	information) which let you write powerful   filtering conditions 
	while keeping the syntax natural and readable
	* Added <when condition="..." action="..." /> filter which uses condition
	expressions
	* Added examples for the MailTarget and BufferedMailTarget
	* Fixed Close() behaviour for unnamed targets (like the ones configured
	by SimpleConfigurator)
	* Added some more documentation (still some work to do before the release)

	supported and is replaced by the AsyncWrapper target)

	* Refactored NLogViewer by separating NLogViewer.Interfaces
	* Added NLogViewer.NDumbsterSmtpReceiver (by Ron Grabowski)
	* Added support for caching layout results per logEvent which
	makes them transportable across threads
	* Renamed Target.Append() method to Write() (how did I forget it?)
	* Added Target.Write(LogEvent[] manyEvents) for cases where the
	target can optimize group writes
	* Added Log4JXmlEvent.cs
