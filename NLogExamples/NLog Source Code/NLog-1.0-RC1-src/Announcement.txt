NLog version 0.95 has been released!

NLog is a .NET logging library designed with simplicity and flexibility 
in mind. With NLog you can process diagnostic messages emitted from 
any .NET language, augment them with contextual information, format 
them according to your preference and send them to one or more targets.

The API (application programming interface) is similar to log4net, 
and the configuration is very simple. NLog uses a routing table 
while log4net uses a logger hierarchy with attachable appenders. 
This makes NLog's configuration very easy to read and maintain. 
The new release includes some architectural changes, 
new features, speed improvements and bug fixes.
